        "\n",
        "  - The role of a Data Analyst is to collect, clean, organize, and analyze data so that a company can make better decisions. A data analyst looks at raw data, finds patterns, creates reports or dashboards, and helps explain what the data means in a simple way for the team or management.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -  the value a data analyst bring to an organization is that they turn data into useful insights. Instead of guessing, a company can rely on data to understand what is working, what is not, and where improvements are needed. This helps the organization save time, reduce mistakes, improve performance, and make smarter business decisions. In short, a data analyst helps a company grow by using data to support every important decision.\n",

        "  - Clean and Prepare the Data=Data often contains errors, missing values, or duplicate entries. In this step, the analyst cleans the data and organizes it into a usable format. This is one of the most important steps.\n",
        "  - Explore and Analyze the Data=Here, the analyst looks for patterns, trends, and relationships using statistical methods, charts, or queries. This helps in understanding what the data reveals.\n",
        "  - Build Insights or Models=Based on the analysis, insights are generated or simple models may be created to answer the problem. This step connects data findings to business needs.\n",
        "  - Visualize the Results=Dashboards, charts, and graphs are created to clearly present the key insights so that non-technical stakeholders can easily understand the outcome.\n",
        "  - Communicate Findings & Recommend Actions=Finally, the analyst explains the results to the team or management and gives suggestions on what actions should be taken based on the insights.\n",
